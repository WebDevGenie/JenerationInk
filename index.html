          Jeneration Ink was founded in 2014 by Jen Kinnane. Jen's love of
          aesthetics started in 2003 when she completed a Diploma of Makeup and
          Special Effects. Her eye for detail and artistic ability saw her
          enhance and transform hundreds of faces around Australia at Fashions
          shows and events. Struggling with adult acne, Jen then studied a
          Diploma of Beauty Therapy in 2005. She wanted to learn how to help
          other people who suffered the same condition. After several years in
          the beauty industry, Jen's passion for knowledge saw her transition
          into Dermal Science and and she opened her business in 2014. Results
          driven and eager to expand her skills and further help more people,
          Jen was invited to train with Australia's leading cosmetic tattoo
          academy and commenced tattooing eyebrows, lips and eyeliner from 2017.
          From here she developed her skills and became certified in paramedical
          tattooing. Being highly sort after for natural enhancements, Jen is
          also a certified Scalp Micropigmentation Specialist, offering
          non-surgical, permanent hair loss procedures.

          Through yearly advanced national and international training courses,
          Jen strives to offer the very best in techniques and industry
          knowledge, offering mentorship programs for newly trained artists,
          contributing to raising industry standards.

          "Restoring a person's confidence and healing through tattoo is the
          most rewarding profession and my mission is to help as many people as
          I can with these life-changing procedures." Jen
